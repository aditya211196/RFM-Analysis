# RFM-Analysis


Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to identify and retain their most valuable customers. Without targeted strategies, marketing efforts may be inefficient or misdirected. This project tackles the challenge of understanding customer value and engagement levels using historical purchase data.

Approach
Data Preparation: Extracted transaction data, converted purchase dates, and engineered RFM features for each customer.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed how recency, frequency, and monetary value varied across the customer base and impacted lifetime value.

KMeans Clustering:

Applied scaling and used the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters.

Clustered customers into distinct segments based on RFM features.

Cluster Profiling:

Summarized each clusterâ€™s average recency, frequency, spending, and lifetime value.

Identified high-value loyal customers, potential churners, and re-engagement opportunities.
