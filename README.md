# RFM-Analysis


RFM-based customer segmentation project for an e-commerce platform aimed at identifying key customer segments to drive targeted retention and marketing strategies. Transaction data was used to compute recency, frequency, and monetary value for each customer, followed by exploratory analysis to understand how these dimensions relate to customer lifetime value. KMeans clustering was applied to group customers into distinct segments such as loyal customers, infrequent high spenders, and disengaged users. The segmentation enabled the design of loyalty programs, re-engagement campaigns, and upsell initiatives, supporting data-driven decisions for optimizing customer lifetime value and marketing ROI.rtunities.
